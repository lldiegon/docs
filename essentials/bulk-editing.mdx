## Actions you can do
First you select all the products you would like to edit, then click on the red 'Bulk Editing' button and select the action.

<Tip>

You can use the filters and search before clicking on select all, to quickly get the right selection.

</Tip>

### Change price

You can increase or decrease the price of the selected products in two ways:
- By Percentage
- By Fixed Amount


Useful when for example product purchasing costs increase or you need to quickly adjust a lot of products for inflation.

You can also add ```-``` before the number you fill in to decrease the price.

### Update Status

Products can have the status 'Reviewed' or 'Unreviewed', when you import products they're 'Unreviewed' by default.
It's intended to use as a marker for product data you've reviewed / checked after enriching them with ai.

That way you can quickly select only the products that have gotten a quality check and use that selection to export it to your webshop.


### Delete Selected Products

Quickly remove products you don't need anymore from WISEPIM.

### Find and Replace

Find and Replace can work on the following product information:
- Product Name
- Description
- Reviewed Description

The find and replace function is case-insensitive and will change all found occurrances in the selected target.

<Tip>

You can use Find and Replace to change all the urls or brand names in a description.

</Tip>

<Tip>

It's also possible to leave the 'Replace with' field empty to remove text.
